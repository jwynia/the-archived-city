{player_name} decides that this mystery is too big for one person to tackle alone. {player_pronoun_subject} needs allies with different perspectives and talents—people who can see what {player_pronoun_subject} might miss and contribute skills {player_pronoun_subject} doesn't possess.

Mira's whispered admission that she had seen similar anomalies gives {player_pronoun_object} a starting point. But {player_pronoun_subject} will need to be careful. If the Concordat is deliberately ignoring or concealing these patterns, assembling a team could draw unwanted attention.

{player_pronoun_subject} begins by creating a list of potential collaborators, considering their skills, access, and—most importantly—their trustworthiness. {player_pronoun_subject} needs people who will keep an open mind about findings that contradict official narratives.

How will {player_name} begin building {player_pronoun_possessive} team?

* [Approach Mira first]
    {player_name} decides to start with Mira. Despite their professional rivalry, her interest in the anomalous patterns suggests she might be willing to collaborate.
    
    {player_pronoun_subject} finds her alone in the Chronicle Chamber late one evening, when most other Chroniclers have left for the day.
    
    "I've been documenting more of those patterns we discussed," {player_pronoun_subject} says quietly, watching her reaction carefully. "The ones the system keeps misclassifying as residue."
    
    Mira's expression shifts from surprise to cautious interest. "Show me," she says, glancing toward the door to ensure they're not overheard.
    
    {player_name} shares some of {player_pronoun_possessive} findings, and her eyes widen. "I've seen similar patterns in the Academic District," she admits. "The Concordat classification system doesn't have categories for these structures."
    
    By the end of their conversation, they've formed a tentative alliance. Mira's expertise in classification systems will complement {player_name}'s field observations.

    -> END

* [Seek out a Veil Engineer]
    {player_name} needs someone who understands the technical aspects of magical infrastructure. A Veil Engineer would have the expertise to analyze the structural properties of these anomalous patterns.
    
    Through careful inquiries, {player_pronoun_subject} identifies Reed Circuitry, a Veil Engineer with a reputation for unorthodox thinking. {player_pronoun_subject} arranges to "accidentally" encounter them at The Liminal Cafe in the Threshold District.
    
    After establishing rapport through discussion of standard magical theory, {player_pronoun_subject} cautiously broaches the subject of anomalies in the Old Quarter.
    
    "Interesting you should mention that," Reed says, lowering their voice. "I've had to recalibrate my instruments several times in that area. The standard calibration patterns don't quite... align with what's actually there."
    
    Reed's technical knowledge could be invaluable, particularly for understanding how these ancient patterns interact with modern magical systems.
    
    // This would continue in a future implementation
    -> END

* [Contact a Threshold Society member]
    If anyone would be interested in magical knowledge outside Concordat control, it would be the Threshold Society. Their belief in free access to magical information makes them natural allies for {player_name}'s investigation.
    
    Finding them won't be easy—they operate through informal networks rather than official channels. But {player_pronoun_subject} has heard rumors that certain establishments in the Threshold District serve as contact points.
    
    At The Crossroads Market, {player_pronoun_subject} leaves a carefully coded message at a particular stall. Three days later, {player_pronoun_subject} receives a response: a location and time for a meeting.
    
    {player_name} arrives at an abandoned workshop to find a figure waiting in the shadows. They introduce themselves simply as "Ash."
    
    "So, a {player_title} has noticed the old patterns," they say. "We've been watching them for years. The question is: what do you intend to do with this knowledge?"
