You decide that this mystery is too big for one person to tackle alone. You need allies with different perspectives and talents—people who can see what you might miss and contribute skills you don't possess.

Mira's whispered admission that she had seen similar anomalies gives you a starting point. But you'll need to be careful. If the Concordat is deliberately ignoring or concealing these patterns, assembling a team could draw unwanted attention.

You begin by creating a list of potential collaborators, considering their skills, access, and—most importantly—their trustworthiness. You need people who will keep an open mind about findings that contradict official narratives.

How will you begin building your team?

* [Approach Mira first]
    You decide to start with Mira. Despite your professional rivalry, her interest in the anomalous patterns suggests she might be willing to collaborate.
    
    You find her alone in the Chronicle Chamber late one evening, when most other Chroniclers have left for the day.
    
    "I've been documenting more of those patterns we discussed," you say quietly, watching her reaction carefully. "The ones the system keeps misclassifying as residue."
    
    Mira's expression shifts from surprise to cautious interest. "Show me," she says, glancing toward the door to ensure you're not overheard.
    
    You share some of your findings, and her eyes widen. "I've seen similar patterns in the Academic District," she admits. "The Concordat classification system doesn't have categories for these structures."
    
    By the end of your conversation, you've formed a tentative alliance. Mira's expertise in classification systems will complement your field observations.

* [Seek out a Veil Engineer]
    You need someone who understands the technical aspects of magical infrastructure. A Veil Engineer would have the expertise to analyze the structural properties of these anomalous patterns.
    
    Through careful inquiries, you identify Reed Circuitry, a Veil Engineer with a reputation for unorthodox thinking. You arrange to "accidentally" encounter them at The Liminal Cafe in the Threshold District.
    
    After establishing rapport through discussion of standard magical theory, you cautiously broach the subject of anomalies in the Old Quarter.
    
    "Interesting you should mention that," Reed says, lowering their voice. "I've had to recalibrate my instruments several times in that area. The standard calibration patterns don't quite... align with what's actually there."
    
    Reed's technical knowledge could be invaluable, particularly for understanding how these ancient patterns interact with modern magical systems.

    -> END

* [Contact a Threshold Society member]
    If anyone would be interested in magical knowledge outside Concordat control, it would be the Threshold Society. Their belief in free access to magical information makes them natural allies for your investigation.
    
    Finding them won't be easy—they operate through informal networks rather than official channels. But you've heard rumors that certain establishments in the Threshold District serve as contact points.
    
    At The Crossroads Market, you leave a carefully coded message at a particular stall. Three days later, you receive a response: a location and time for a meeting.
    
    You arrive at an abandoned workshop to find a figure waiting in the shadows. They introduce themselves simply as "Ash."
    
    "So, a Chronicler has noticed the old patterns," they say. "We've been watching them for years. The question is: what do you intend to do with this knowledge?"
