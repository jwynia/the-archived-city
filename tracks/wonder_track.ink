// Scene 6W: Breakthrough Discovery
// ===================================

=== scene_6W_breakthrough_discovery ===
{player_name} stands before the experimental array, the resonance wand, and the iridescent sand—all the fragments of {player_pronoun_possessive} research converging in this moment. The air hums with potential, charged by days of relentless pursuit.

A deep breath. A decision to **abandon Concordat protocols** and trust intuition.

{player_pronoun_subject} closes {player_pronoun_possessive} eyes, letting go of rigid control, and instead **invites** the magic to respond.

At first, nothing. Then—

A surge of sensation:  
- **Light** blooms behind {player_pronoun_possessive} eyelids, swirling in impossible colors.  
- **Sound** resonates like a symphony of crystal and thunder.  
- **Touch** becomes a current flowing through {player_pronoun_possessive} veins.  
- The **scent** of ozone and wildflowers fills the space.  
- A taste like **metal and honey** on {player_pronoun_possessive} tongue.

The environment **transforms**. Walls dissolve into flowing patterns. The Veil thins, revealing a vast, living tapestry of energy and intention.

{player_name} perceives **ancient magic** as a **conversation**—responsive, harmonious, alive. It **welcomes** {player_pronoun_object}, recognizing a seeker beyond imposed limits.

Suddenly, **insight floods** {player_pronoun_possessive} mind:

- The **Concordat system** was engineered to **limit** access, to keep true magic suppressed and controllable.
- The **Awakening** was a **partial, deliberate thinning** of the Veil, hiding deeper power.
- Ancient magic is **intuitive**, **collaborative**, and **vastly more efficient**.
- The protagonist's own **latent potential** awakens, sparking new abilities.

{player_pronoun_subject} gasps, overwhelmed by the **beauty and scale** of what {player_pronoun_subject} now understands.

The insight **contradicts everything** {player_pronoun_subject} was taught. It is **dangerous knowledge**—and a key to true freedom.

{player_pronoun_subject} steadies {player_pronoun_possessive} breath as the vision stabilizes, offering a moment of choice:

* [Embrace this new understanding fully]
    {player_pronoun_subject} lets the revelation reshape {player_pronoun_object}, committing to this deeper magic.

    ~ social_capital += 1
    "Not yet," {player_pronoun_subject} thinks. "The world isn't ready."
    -> scene_7_convergence_placeholder

=== scene_7_convergence_placeholder ===
{player_name} feels the last echoes of the revelation fade, leaving a new clarity—and new questions.

Soon, {player_pronoun_subject} will face the consequences of this insight, as all paths converge toward the deeper truth behind the Awakening.

-> END
