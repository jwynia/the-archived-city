You decide to focus on understanding how this anomalous magic works, rather than tracing its origins. The flowing, organic structure of these enchantments suggests a fundamentally different approach to magical manipulation—one that might offer insights beyond the rigid systems of the Concordat.

Your apartment gradually transforms into an impromptu research laboratory. Data-crystals containing your observations glow softly on your desk. The walls are covered with sketches of the patterns you've documented, connected by threads that represent your developing theories.

You begin by analyzing the structural differences between standard Concordat enchantments and the anomalous patterns. Where Concordat magic relies on precise geometric forms and standardized components, these ancient patterns follow natural principles—spirals, branching structures, and flowing curves that mimic patterns found in nature.

How will you proceed with your investigation?

* [Develop a theoretical model]
    You decide to approach this systematically, developing a theoretical framework to explain how this different form of magic functions.
    
    Drawing on your Chronicler training, you create a comparative analysis of Concordat magic versus the anomalous patterns. You map energy flows, structural principles, and response characteristics.
    
    A pattern emerges: Concordat magic imposes structure on magical energy, forcing it into predetermined forms. The ancient magic, by contrast, seems to work with the natural flow of energy, guiding rather than controlling it.
    
    Your model suggests that this approach might be more efficient and adaptable, though potentially less predictable and standardized.

* [Create a ritual tool for interaction]
    Theory has its place, but you need practical interaction to truly understand. You decide to create a tool that will allow you to safely interact with the anomalous magic.
    
    Using components from your standard Chronicler kit, modified based on your observations, you craft a resonance wand—a device designed to attune to and amplify the subtle vibrations of the ancient patterns.
    
    The creation process is challenging. Standard magical components resist being reconfigured in ways that contradict their design. But gradually, through careful adjustments and intuitive modifications, you develop something new.
    
    When complete, the wand feels different in your hand—alive in a way your standard tools never have.

* [Consult with magical creatures]
    Some questions can't be answered through observation alone. You decide to seek wisdom from entities that might have a different perspective on magic.
    
    The Veil District houses several establishments where magical creatures gather. Though most avoid interaction with Concordat officials, your research might interest them.
    
    At The Shimmer Market, you find a small shop tucked between more prominent establishments. Inside, a shopkeeper with iridescent skin and eyes like polished opals greets you.
    
    "A Chronicler seeking knowledge beyond the books? How refreshing," they say, their voice melodic. "What brings you to my humble establishment?"
