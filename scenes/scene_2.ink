// Scene 2: The Pattern in the Veil
// ===================================

=== scene_2_the_pattern_in_the_veil ===
The Old Quarter greets you with its familiar blend of history and mystery. Narrow cobblestone streets wind between buildings of varying ages, some dating back centuries before the Awakening. Unlike the Administrative District with its obvious magical enhancements, the magic here is subtle—woven into the very fabric of the place.

You activate your spectral visor, and the mundane world overlays with the shimmering patterns of sanctioned enchantments. Blue-green wards flow along the edges of buildings, gold-tinged protection spells form domes over important intersections, and the steady pulse of maintenance enchantments runs beneath the streets like magical plumbing.

All perfectly normal. All meticulously documented in your records.

Until you turn down Antiquarian Row.

A flicker of something... different catches your attention. You adjust your visor's sensitivity, focusing on a faint pattern etched into the wall of an old bookshop. The magic doesn't glow with the standardized colors of Concordat enchantments. Instead, it shimmers with an opalescent quality, shifting between hues that aren't even in your classification handbook.

* [Examine the pattern more closely]
    You step closer to the wall, adjusting your visor to its highest sensitivity. The pattern seems to respond to your attention, the colors shifting more rapidly as you focus on it.
    
    It's not just the color that's unusual—the structure itself follows no standardized format. Where Concordat enchantments use precise geometric forms, this magic flows in organic curves that somehow feel more... natural.
    
    You reach out tentatively with your magical senses, not touching the pattern but trying to get a better reading.
    
    The response is immediate and unexpected. For just a moment, your perception shifts, and you see the entire street differently—buildings that seem more alive, connections between structures that weren't visible before, and most disturbingly, what appears to be a doorway where you know there is only solid wall.
    
    Then your vision snaps back to normal, leaving you slightly disoriented.
    -> pattern_discovery

* [Document the anomaly]
    You maintain a professional distance and begin the standard documentation procedure. Your enchanted stylus records the exact location, apparent age, and visible characteristics of the pattern.
    
    As you work, you notice something odd about the data being recorded. The pattern seems to resist standard classification. The timestamp keeps shifting slightly, and the magical signature reading fluctuates between "unregistered enchantment" and "background magical noise."
    
    When you attempt to capture an image, your documentation tools produce only a blurred approximation, as if the pattern is somehow evading precise recording.
    -> pattern_discovery

* [Check the official records]
    You access the Concordat database through your visor, searching for any record of authorized enchantments at this location.
    
    The database returns a standard response: "Location contains standard structural integrity wards and commercial protection enchantments, last updated 3 years ago. No anomalies reported."
    
    You look back at the wall. The pattern is definitely there, and definitely not a standard ward. Either the database is incomplete, or this magic has somehow escaped official notice.
    -> pattern_discovery

=== pattern_discovery ===
Whatever this is, it doesn't match any magical signature in your experience. More concerning is the fact that it appears old—possibly predating the standardized enchantment systems implemented after the Awakening.

But that should be impossible. Magic only returned to the world thirty years ago.

You attempt to log the anomaly in the official Concordat reporting system. After a moment of processing, the system responds:

"CLASSIFICATION: MINOR AMBIENT RESIDUE. No further action required. Residual magical patterns occasionally form in areas of high magical traffic. These patterns are non-functional echoes and will dissipate naturally."

You frown. This doesn't look like residue. It looks deliberate, structured, and most importantly, stable.

* [Consult with Elias privately]
    That evening, you find Elias in his private office at the Concordat Tower. You describe what you found, careful to keep your tone professional and your observations precise.
    
    Elias listens attentively, his expression growing increasingly guarded. When you finish, he's silent for a long moment.
    
    "These old buildings," he finally says, his voice carefully measured. "They've absorbed a lot of magical energy over the years. Sometimes it creates... echoes. Patterns that look meaningful but are just artifacts."
    
    You notice he won't quite meet your eyes.
    
    "I wouldn't concern yourself with it further," he continues. "And perhaps don't mention it to others. The Concordat has enough to deal with without chasing magical ghosts."
    
    As you leave his office, you can't shake the feeling that his dismissal was too practiced, too quick.

* [Discuss it with Mira]
    The next day, you casually mention the strange pattern to Mira while you're both working in the Chronicle Chamber.
    
    To your surprise, her usual competitive demeanor fades, replaced by genuine interest. "Where exactly did you see this?" she asks, her voice lowered.
    
    When you describe the location and the pattern's appearance, she glances around to ensure no one is listening.
    
    "I've seen something similar in District Three," she admits. "The system classified it as residue too, but..." She hesitates. "It responded when I tried to analyze it. Residue doesn't do that."
    
    Before you can discuss it further, another Chronicler approaches, and Mira quickly changes the subject. But as she turns away, she whispers, "Be careful what you put in official reports about this."
    -> scene_2_ending

* [Investigate on your own]
    You decide to keep your discovery to yourself for now. Over the next few days, you return to the Old Quarter during your free time, documenting similar patterns that the official systems consistently misclassify as residue.
    
    You begin to notice a troubling pattern—these anomalies appear primarily in the city's oldest structures, and they all share that same organic, flowing quality that differs so dramatically from standardized Concordat magic.
    
    In your private notes, you map the locations of these patterns. When viewed together, they seem to form a larger structure—like pieces of a vast, fragmented enchantment spread throughout the city.
    
    Most disturbing of all: according to your analysis, some of these magical traces appear to have been created before the Awakening. Which should be impossible.

In the weeks that follow, you continue your official duties while keeping a watchful eye for more anomalous patterns. You find them with increasing frequency once you know what to look for—hidden in plain sight throughout the Old Quarter and occasionally in other historic districts.

The Concordat systems consistently classify them as insignificant, yet your instincts tell you otherwise. These patterns are too structured, too responsive to be mere residue. They feel like fragments of a different magical language—one that predates the Concordat's standardized systems.

One evening, as you're updating your private notes, your data-crystal unexpectedly illuminates with a pattern matching the anomalies you've been tracking. For just a moment, the Old Quarter Enchantment Matrix you've been studying reveals a hidden layer—connections and structures that aren't recorded in any official documentation.

Then it's gone, leaving you with more questions than answers.

The anomalous magical pattern continues to appear in your chronicles, though official systems won't acknowledge it. You need to decide how to proceed.
