## Character Naming Framework

Following the Universal Contextual Character Naming Framework, character names in this urban fantasy setting reflect:

### Time/Era Parameters
- **Pre-Awakening Names**: Traditional names with minimal magical influence
- **Post-Awakening Names**: Names that incorporate magical concepts, particularly for those born after the event
- **Ancient Entity Names**: Names that reflect timeless qualities, often with nature or elemental components

### Social Structure Parameters
- **Concordat Officials**: Names with classical roots, often incorporating Latin or Greek elements
- **Threshold Society**: Names that blend traditional elements with modern forms
- **Mundane Administration**: Names that maintain conventional patterns to blend with non-magical society
- **Old Court Entities**: Names with shifting syllables that humans have difficulty pronouncing consistently

### Power Systems Parameters
- **First Generation Mages**: (Awakened after adulthood) Maintain birth names with magical honorifics
- **Second Generation Mages**: Names often incorporate magical concepts or functions
- **Old Lineage Mages**: Names follow traditional magical naming patterns, often reflecting elemental or conceptual affiliations
- **Non-magical Characters**: Names that reflect mundane cultural backgrounds

### Cultural Context Parameters
- **Chroniclers**: Names often incorporate concepts of memory, record-keeping, or observation
- **Veil Engineers**: Names that blend technical and magical elements
- **Keepers of the First Veil**: Names with natural elements and subtle magical references

### Naming Implementation Guidelines
1. **Function-Form Relationship**: Names should reflect character function (e.g., "Cipher Nightwise" for a concealment specialist)
2. **System Integration**: Names should integrate with magical systems (e.g., "Septimus Veil" for Concordat official)
3. **Cultural Evolution Logic**: Names should follow logical patterns based on when/how character encountered magic
4. **Phonetic Consistency**: Related groups should share phonetic patterns (e.g., Old Court names have similar rhythms)
5. **Beyond-the-Bell-Curve Selection**: Choose distinctive but believable names (50th-95th percentile range)
