# World Building

## Universe Rules
- Magic reemerged 30 years ago in the "Awakening"
- The Awakening was deliberately engineered and incomplete
- Reality exists in multiple overlapping layers (mundane, Veil)
- The "First Veil" is an ancient metaphysical barrier that was partially thinned
- Only certain types of magic became accessible, while deeper/older forms remained hidden
- Awakened magic requires formal structures and components, making it regulatable
- Veil interaction requires magical aptitude (approximately 3% of population)
- Chroniclers maintain records of supernatural infrastructure
- Blend of modern technology and magical accommodations
- The barrier continues weakening in unpredictable ways over the decades
- Those who perceived magic before the Awakening ("Dreamers") experienced enhanced abilities

## Magic System
- **Post-Awakening Magic (Concordat System):** Highly systematized, requires training/licensing, standardized rituals, registered enchantments, focus on utility and control
- **Ancient Magic (The First Veil):** Intuitive, responsive to intention, relies on personal connection, self-sustaining enchantments, focus on harmony and transformation
- **Wild Magic:** Unpredictable, dangerous, manifests from strong emotions, unstable effects, appears in neglected areas, chaotic transformation

## Historical Context
- The "Awakening" (30 years ago): Not magic returning, but thinning of a barrier
- "Keepers of the First Veil": Maintained knowledge of magic throughout history
- Deliberate triggering of the Awakening for unknown purposes
- Initial manifestations centered on areas with historical magical significance
- The Awakening occurred simultaneously worldwide but manifested differently by region

- **Market Stratification:** Three-tier market system (high-end custom enchantments, mass-market standard charms, black market banned magic)
- **Insurance Evolution:** Development of magical liability coverage and anti-enchantment protection policies
- **Property Law Reformation:** Creation of "metaphysical easement" legal concepts for magical effects crossing property lines
- **Employment Transformation:** Magical aptitude testing becoming standard in hiring practices

## Social Structure
- **New Elite Class:** Magically talented individuals with business acumen forming a new upper class
- **Knowledge as Currency:** Historical magical information becoming extremely valuable
- **Institutional Restructuring:** Traditional power centers (universities, governments) struggling to maintain relevance
- **Democratic Challenges:** Voting and representation systems complicated by magical influence concerns
- **Corporate Consolidation:** Major companies establishing magical divisions that gradually dominated their organizations
- **Identity Formation:** "Awakened" vs. "Mundane" becoming primary social identifiers

- **Wealth Gap Acceleration:** Magical advantage amplifying existing inequalities at exponential rates

## Cultural Evolution
- **Language Development:** Thousands of new terms for magical phenomena, magical terminology indicating educational/class position
- **Metaphor Transformation:** Magical terms entering everyday language ("her wards are up" = she's being defensive)
- **Ethical Framework Shifts:** Complex frameworks regarding magical influence, challenges to ownership concepts
- **Privacy Reconceptualization:** Fundamental questioning of privacy when divination exists
- **Artistic Responses:** Emergence of spell-weaving as performance art, enchanted sculptures, emotion-influencing music

## Factions
