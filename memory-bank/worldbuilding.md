# World Building

## Universe Rules
- Magic reemerged 30 years ago in the "Awakening"
- Reality exists in multiple overlapping layers (mundane, Veil)
- Veil interaction requires magical aptitude
- Chroniclers maintain records of supernatural infrastructure
- Blend of modern technology and magical accommodations

## Magic System
- **Post-Awakening Magic (Concordat System):** Highly systematized, requires training/licensing, standardized rituals, registered enchantments, focus on utility and control
- **Ancient Magic (The First Veil):** Intuitive, responsive to intention, relies on personal connection, self-sustaining enchantments, focus on harmony and transformation
- **Wild Magic:** Unpredictable, dangerous, manifests from strong emotions, unstable effects, appears in neglected areas, chaotic transformation

## Historical Context
- The "Awakening" (30 years ago): Not magic returning, but thinning of a barrier
- "Keepers of the First Veil": Maintained knowledge of magic throughout history
- Deliberate triggering of the Awakening for unknown purposes

## Factions
- **The Concordat:** Regulatory body of mages and supernatural entities
- **Veil Engineers:** Maintain sanctioned enchantments
- **Threshold Society:** Believe in free access to magical knowledge
- **The Mundane Administration:** Government officials who liaise with magical entities
- **Old Courts:** Ancient supernatural power structures
