- **Wild Magic Incursions:** Unpredictable manifestations of unregulated magic can temporarily transform areas, particularly in less maintained districts. These incursions are becoming more frequent as the Veils continue to thin.
- **Temporal Fluctuations:** Certain areas experience time differently based on magical density, with some locations having noticeable time dilation effects.
