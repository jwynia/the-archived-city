# Character Naming Guidelines

This document integrates the Universal Contextual Character Naming Framework into our urban fantasy setting, providing specific guidelines for naming characters based on their relationship to magic, social position, and function in the story.

## Parameter-Based Naming Matrices

### Time/Era Parameters
- **Pre-Awakening Names**: Traditional names with minimal magical influence
  - Examples: James Walker, Sarah Chen, Michael Rodriguez
  - Usage: Characters who were adults before the Awakening and maintain their birth names
  
- **Post-Awakening Names**: Names that incorporate magical concepts
  - Examples: Aurora Spellbound, Lumen Brightpath, Rune Shadowcast
  - Usage: Characters born after the Awakening or who adopted new names after magical awakening
  
- **Ancient Entity Names**: Names reflecting timeless qualities
  - Examples: Lady Summer-In-Stone, The Archivist-Who-Remembers, Whisper-Between-Worlds
  - Usage: Old Court entities and ancient magical beings

### Social Structure Parameters
- **Concordat Officials**: Classical roots with formal titles
  - Examples: Magister Septimus Veil, Archivist Primus Thaddeus Morrow, Enforcer Octavia Stern
  - Pattern: [Title] [Classical Name] [Conceptual Surname]
  
- **Threshold Society**: Blended traditional and modern forms
  - Examples: Ash, Ember Nightfall, Sage Winterborn
  - Pattern: [Simple First Name] [Optional Magical Surname]
  
- **Mundane Administration**: Conventional patterns
  - Examples: Director Eleanor Hayes, Commissioner Thomas Grant, Liaison Katherine Wu
  - Pattern: [Official Title] [Conventional Name]
  
- **Old Court Entities**: Shifting syllabic patterns
  - Examples: Lady Summer-In-Stone, The Keeper-of-Forgotten-Paths, He-Who-Walks-Between
  - Pattern: [Title/Article] [Compound Conceptual Name]

### Power Systems Parameters
- **First Generation Mages**: Birth names with magical honorifics
  - Examples: Leyden Cross, Miranda "Stormcaller" Winters, Jonathan "Lightweaver" Chen
  - Pattern: [Birth Name] ["Magical Epithet"]
  
- **Second Generation Mages**: Names incorporating magical concepts
  - Examples: Cipher Nightwise, Lumen Brightpath, Rune Shadowcast
  - Pattern: [Magical Concept] [Magical Attribute]
  
- **Old Lineage Mages**: Traditional magical naming patterns
  - Examples: Thorn Blackoak, Willow Moonshadow, Rowan Stormheart
  - Pattern: [Natural Element] [Compound Magical Attribute]
  
- **Non-magical Characters**: Mundane cultural backgrounds
  - Examples: David Miller, Jennifer Wong, Carlos Mendez
  - Pattern: [Conventional First Name] [Conventional Surname]

### Cultural Context Parameters
- **Chroniclers**: Concepts of memory and record-keeping
  - Examples: Elias Thorne, Mira Lockwell, Scribe Evelyn Pageturn
  - Pattern: [Traditional First Name] [Record/Memory-Related Surname]
  
- **Veil Engineers**: Blended technical and magical elements
  - Examples: Artificer Reed Circuitry, Mason Stonebind, Architect Iris Patternweave
  - Pattern: [Technical Title/Name] [Technical-Magical Compound]
  
- **Keepers of the First Veil**: Natural elements with subtle magic
  - Examples: Sage Willowbrook, Keeper Aspen Truepath, Guardian Rowan Deeproot
  - Pattern: [Keeper Title] [Natural Element] [Path/Truth Concept]

## Practical Implementation Process

1. **Identify Character Parameters**:
   - When did they encounter magic? (Pre/Post Awakening)
   - What faction or social group do they belong to?
   - What is their relationship to magical systems?
   - What is their function in the story?

2. **Apply Appropriate Naming Strategy**:
   - Select the relevant matrices from the sections above
   - Cross-reference with character function
   - Consider phonetic patterns of related character groups

3. **Generate Name Options**:
   - Create 3-5 name options following the pattern
   - Ensure names are pronounceable but distinctive
   - Check for unintended meanings or associations

4. **Select Final Name**:
   - Choose from the 50th-95th percentile range (distinctive but believable)
   - Ensure it fits with existing character naming patterns
   - Verify it conveys appropriate information about the character

## Examples from Current Characters

- **Elias Thorne** (Senior Chronicler):
  - Parameters: Pre-Awakening, Chronicler, possible Keeper connection
  - Analysis: "Elias" is traditional, while "Thorne" suggests both protection and danger
  - Function-Form: Name suggests someone who guards knowledge that might be dangerous

- **Mira Lockwell** (Rival Chronicler):
  - Parameters: Likely Post-Awakening, Chronicler, ambitious
  - Analysis: "Mira" suggests observation (mirror/seeing), "Lockwell" combines security and depth
  - Function-Form: Name suggests someone who keeps secrets secure and hidden

- **Concordat Magister Septimus Veil**:
  - Parameters: Concordat Official, high-ranking
  - Analysis: "Septimus" (seventh) suggests hierarchy, "Veil" directly references magical barriers
  - Function-Form: Name suggests someone who maintains separation between magical realms

- **Ash** (Threshold Society):
  - Parameters: Threshold Society, simplified name
  - Analysis: Single-word name suggests transformation (remains after fire)
  - Function-Form: Name suggests someone who has been transformed by magic and emerged simplified

- **Lady Summer-In-Stone** (Old Court):
  - Parameters: Ancient Entity, Old Court
  - Analysis: Compound nature-based conceptual name with contradictory elements
  - Function-Form: Name suggests a being who embodies the preservation of a season (timelessness)

## Beyond-the-Bell-Curve Name Generation

To create names that are distinctive yet believable:

1. **Research Actual Name Distribution**:
   - For mundane characters, research actual name popularity for their demographic
   - For magical characters, establish patterns based on magical tradition

2. **Select from 50th-95th Percentile Range**:
   - Common enough to be believable
   - Uncommon enough to be memorable
   - Avoid both top 10 names and extremely rare names

3. **Apply Unexpected Combinations**:
   - Combine traditional first names with magical surnames
   - Mix cultural naming traditions in logical ways
   - Create compound names that follow consistent patterns

4. **Introduce Logical Linguistic Drift**:
   - Consider how names might evolve in magical communities
   - Adapt traditional names with magical influences
   - Create naming conventions that reflect magical history

5. **Create Name Families**:
   - Develop consistent patterns for related groups
   - Ensure phonetic consistency within factions
   - Create naming hierarchies that reflect power structures
