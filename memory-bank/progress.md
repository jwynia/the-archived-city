   - Ensure each scene has a clear value shift
   - Add progressive complications before resolutions
   - Create dramatic turning points with higher stakes
   - Incorporate socioeconomic perspectives in each track

2. Implement Scene 7: The First Truth (convergence point)

   - Implement second major choice point with four new tracks

3. Develop protagonist background selection
   - Create class-specific starting variables
   - Implement dialogue variations based on background
   - Develop variable display contexts

4. Develop the second set of tracks
   - Issue Track: Exposing the Concordat's manipulation
   - Idea/Wonder Track: Recovering ancient magical understanding
   - Relationship/Thriller Track: Protecting the Keepers
   - Drama Track: Understanding personal connection to magic

5. Implement Scene 10: The Thinning Veil

6. Add testing infrastructure to verify story flow and variable tracking

## Known Issues
- Scene turns need strengthening to create more dramatic value shifts
- Elemental genres need more specific emotional payoffs
- Socioeconomic dimensions need more explicit integration in player choices
- Need to balance systemic worldbuilding exposition with narrative pacing
- Need to update scene files to reflect the enhanced worldbuilding
- Need to ensure consistency in how socioeconomic factors affect magical perception across all scenes
