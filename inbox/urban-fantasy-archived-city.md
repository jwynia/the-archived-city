# The Archived City: Urban Fantasy Edition

## Core Concept
In a modern city where magic has reemerged in the last thirty years, reality exists in multiple overlapping layers. Most citizens experience only the mundane layer, while those with magical aptitude can perceive and interact with the Veil - magical overlays that contain supernatural entities, enchantments, and hidden pathways. The protagonist is a "Chronicler" - part archivist, part mage - who maintains the official magical records of the city's supernatural infrastructure.

## Setting Elements

### The City of Nexus
- Once ordinary until the "Awakening" 30 years ago when magic returned to the world
- Architecture blends modern design with retrofitted magical accommodations
- Different districts have varying levels of magical integration and regulation
- Governed by both mundane authorities and a magical council (the Concordat)

### The Veil System
- Multiple magical overlays that exist parallel to physical reality
- The "Sanctioned Veil" - officially recognized and regulated magical layer
- "Wild Veils" - unpredictable pockets of unregulated magical reality
- "Deep Veils" - ancient magical strata predating modern civilization
- Chroniclers maintain the official records of all sanctioned magical structures

### Factions
- **The Concordat**: Official regulatory body of mages and supernatural entities
- **Veil Engineers**: Magical technicians who build and maintain sanctioned enchantments
- **Threshold Society**: Secretive group believing in free access to all magical knowledge
- **The Mundane Administration**: Government officials who liaise with magical entities
- **Old Courts**: Ancient supernatural power structures that predate human civilization

## Protagonist Background
The protagonist is a Chronicler, trained in both magical theory and historical preservation. Their job involves cataloging magical structures, updating official records, and ensuring the stability of sanctioned enchantments. They possess moderate magical talent focused on perception and documentation rather than combat or major enchantment.

## Initial Scene Sequence

### Status Quo Establishment
**Scene 1: "Veils of Record"**
- Protagonist's daily routine: maintaining magical archives, updating enchantment records
- Introduction of mentor (Senior Chronicler) and rival (ambitious fellow Chronicler)
- Demonstration of how most citizens are unaware of magical activities occurring around them
- Established tension between regulated magic and unlicensed practices

### Inciting Anomaly
**Scene 2: "The Pattern in the Veil"**
- During routine maintenance in the Old Quarter, protagonist detects traces of an unregistered magical structure
- The magic uses unfamiliar patterns that match no known magical tradition
- When attempting to report the anomaly, Concordat systems classify it as insignificant
- Mentor appears concerned but dismissive when privately consulted
- First hints that this magic predates the Awakening, which should be impossible

### Response Choice (Genre Determination)
**Scene 3: "Initial Approach"**
```
The anomalous magical pattern continues to appear in your chronicles, though official systems won't acknowledge it. How do you proceed?

1. "I need to trace the source of this magic and who's responsible for it." [MYSTERY track]
2. "This could be an entirely unknown form of magic. I should try to understand how it works." [WONDER/IDEA track]
3. "I should find others who might perceive these patterns and form a team to investigate." [ENSEMBLE track]
4. "I need to access restricted areas where the magical signature is strongest." [ADVENTURE track]
```

## Mystery Track Development

### Investigation Initiation
**Scene 4M: "Hidden Histories"**
- Protagonist searches historical records predating the Awakening
- Discovers references to "dreamers" who claimed to see magical structures before magic was known to exist
- Identifies several locations where similar anomalies were reported but dismissed
- First encounter with a minor supernatural entity who seems frightened by protagonist's questions

### Approach Choice
```
Your investigation points to a group called "The Keepers of the First Veil" that existed before the Awakening. How do you proceed?

1. Track down descendants of these supposed pre-Awakening mages
2. Research city planning archives for unusual construction or preservation decisions that might have protected magical sites
3. Perform a specialized ritual to attune yourself to the specific magical signature
```

### Investigation Deepening
**Scene 5M-A/B/C**: (Branches based on approach)

- Protagonist identifies physical locations with strongest magical anomalies
- Plans expedition to restricted magical zones
- Acquires necessary protections and access methods
- First entry into the magical understructure of the city

### Approach Choice
```
You've identified three locations with unusually strong magical signatures. Which do you explore first?

- Discovery that the Awakening was engineered to introduce a more controllable form of magic
- Evidence that a resistance movement of "Keepers" has maintained knowledge of the original magic
- Protagonist's mentor revealed to have connections to both the Keepers and the Concordat

## Second Major Choice Point

```
With the truth about magic's history revealed, what's your priority now?

1. "We need to expose the Concordat's manipulation of magical knowledge." [ISSUE track]
2. "We should work to recover and spread understanding of the original magic." [IDEA/WONDER track continues]
3. "We must protect the Keepers from discovery and persecution." [RELATIONSHIP/THRILLER hybrid]
4. "I need to understand my own connection to the original magic." [DRAMA track]
```

## Character Naming and Identity Framework

Following the Universal Contextual Character Naming Framework, characters in this urban fantasy setting would have names that reflect:

### Magical Integration Spectrum
- **Concordat Officials**: Names with classical roots, often incorporating Latin or Greek elements
- **Threshold Society**: Names that blend traditional elements with modern forms
- **Old Court Entities**: Names with shifting syllables that humans have difficulty pronouncing consistently

### Magical Heritage
- **First Generation Mages**: (Awakened after adulthood) Maintain birth names with magical honorifics
- **Second Generation Mages**: Names often incorporate magical concepts
- **Old Lineage Mages**: Names follow traditional magical naming patterns, often reflecting elemental or conceptual affiliations

### Sample Character Names

- **Elias Thorne** - Senior Chronicler, protagonist's mentor
- **Mira Lockwell** - Rival Chronicler with political ambitions
- **Concordat Magister Septimus Veil** - High-ranking Concordat official
- **Ash** - Threshold Society contact with deliberately simplified name
- **Lady Summer-In-Stone** - Old Court representative with conceptual name
- **Leyden Cross** - First-generation mage with geological reference
- **Cipher Nightwise** - Second-generation specialist in concealment magic
- **Thorn Blackoak** - Member of an old magical lineage

## Magical System Design

### Post-Awakening Magic (Concordat System)
- Highly systematized with strict categories and classifications
- Requires formal training and licensing
- Uses standardized ritual components and gestures
- Enchantments must be registered and regularly inspected
- Focuses on utility, predictability, and control

### Ancient Magic (The First Veil)
- Intuitive and responsive to intention
- Relies on personal connection to locations and elements
- Changes based on emotional states and needs
- Creates self-sustaining, evolving enchantments
- Focuses on harmony, growth, and transformation

### Wild Magic (Emerging in gaps between systems)
- Unpredictable and often dangerous
- Manifests in response to strong emotional events
- Creates temporally unstable effects
- Often appears in abandoned or neglected areas
- Focuses on chaotic transformation and breaking barriers

## Implementation Notes for Development

- **Variable Tracking:** Key variables would include knowledge of ancient magic, relationship values with various magical factions, magical aptitude in different traditions, and access to different magical locations and resources.

- **Setting Design:** The city itself would be designed with multiple magical layers, from official to hidden, each revealing different aspects of supernatural reality. This creates a rich environment for exploration and discovery.

- **Character Design:** Characters would represent different perspectives on magic—regulatory officials, magical researchers, tradition preservationists, supernatural entities, etc.

- **Name Generation:** Use the Universal Contextual Character Naming Framework to create names that subtly convey information about a character's relationship to magic and position within the magical community.

- **Magical Effects:** Design magical effects that vary based on which layer/tradition the magic is drawn from, creating visual and functional distinctions between magic types.
