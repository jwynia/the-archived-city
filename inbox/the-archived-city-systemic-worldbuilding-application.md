# Systemic Worldbuilding Application: The Archived City

## 1. Initial Divergence Point Analysis

### Core Divergence: The Dual-Nature Awakening
- **Primary Change**: Magic's existence revealed to the world 30 years ago
- **Secondary Change**: The revelation was engineered and incomplete
- **Specific Mechanism**: Partial thinning of an ancient metaphysical barrier (the "First Veil")
- **Immediate Limitations**: Only certain types of magic became accessible, while deeper/older forms remained hidden
- **Control Parameters**: Awakened magic requires formal structures and components, making it regulatable

### Divergence Specificity
- The Awakening occurred simultaneously worldwide but manifested differently by region
- Initial manifestations centered on areas with historical magical significance
- Only certain individuals showed magical aptitude (approximately 3% of population)
- The barrier continued weakening in unpredictable ways over the subsequent decades
- Those who had perceived magic before the Awakening ("Dreamers") experienced enhanced abilities

## 2. Direct Consequences (1st Order)
