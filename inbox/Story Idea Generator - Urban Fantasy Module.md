| Infrastructure | Magic hidden within conventional structures | Parallel magical infrastructure alongside mundane | Fully integrated magical-technological systems |
| Economy | Black market for magical items/services | Specialized magical economic sectors | Economy fundamentally structured around magical resources |
| Law Enforcement | Specialized secret units for supernatural cases | Separate but equal magical and mundane law enforcement | Fully integrated magical-mundane legal system |
| Social Spaces | Hidden magical locations accessible by invitation | Businesses/venues catering to both communities | Fully integrated spaces with magical accommodations as standard |
| Transportation | Conventional transport with occasional magical options | Parallel magical transportation networks | Transportation systems fundamentally magical in nature |

## 5. Urban Fantasy Story Concept Example: Mystery Primary Genre

### Setting Context
- **Magical Revelation:** Hidden world (magic completely unknown to general public)
- **Magical Prevalence:** Uncommon but significant
- **Supernatural Beings:** Diverse supernatural ecosystem
- **Urban Environment:** Major metropolitan city (Chicago)
- **Magical System:** Rule-based with cost elements

### Character Design
**Detective Mira Chen**
- **Background:** Ordinary human drawn into supernatural
- **Societal Function:** Bridge (facilitates understanding between groups)
- **Relationship to Magic:** Resistant (unusually unaffected by some magic)
- **Urban Relationship:** City-wide professional (homicide detective)

### Story Concept: "Binding Shadows"
When a series of seemingly impossible murders occurs across Chicago—victims found in locked rooms with arcane symbols carved into the floors—Detective Mira Chen finds herself partnered with Eli Warden, a reluctant consultant from the city's hidden magical community. The victims appear connected to an ancient magical text that was supposedly destroyed decades ago.

As they investigate, they discover each victim was attempting to bind and control urban spirits associated with different Chicago neighborhoods, entities that exist at the intersection of city infrastructure and collective belief. The murderer is systematically eliminating rival practitioners to complete a ritual that would bind the city's central spirit—essentially gaining control over Chicago itself.

The investigation takes them through layers of the magical community hidden within familiar Chicago landmarks, revealing how magical society has evolved alongside the city's own development. Mira's unusual resistance to certain types of magic makes her uniquely qualified to approach crime scenes that confound magical investigators, while Eli's deep knowledge of magical history helps decode the killer's methodology and intentions.

The mystery deepens when they discover evidence suggesting the killer might be working with someone inside the city government, raising questions about whether control of the city's spirit could influence political outcomes and urban development.
