Universal Contextual Character Naming Framework

1. Parameter-Based Naming Matrices for All Settings
Each setting module needs its own naming matrices focused on:

Time/Era Parameters - How the historical period affects naming conventions
Social Structure Parameters - How societal organization influences names
Power Systems Parameters - How magic/technology/governance affects naming patterns
Cultural Context Parameters - How cultural dynamics shape names

2. Core Principles for Cross-Setting Implementation

Function-Form Relationship - Names should reflect character function within their society
System Integration - Names should integrate with the dominant systems (magical, technological, political)
Cultural Evolution Logic - Names should follow logical evolutionary patterns based on setting history
Phonetic Consistency - Related groups should share phonetic patterns while maintaining individual variation
Naming as Worldbuilding - Names should convey setting information without exposition

3. Setting-Specific Translation
For each setting module, we'd have specific matrices:
Urban Fantasy Names:

Names reflecting degree of magical integration
Names indicating position in supernatural hierarchies
Names showing magical/mundane boundary position
Names revealing generational relationship to magic revelation

Epic Fantasy Names:

Names tied to magical sources/affinities
Names indicating political/clan affiliations
Names reflecting mythic connections
Names showing relationship to prophecy/destiny systems

Historical Fiction Names:

Names reflecting accurate period conventions but with strategic uniqueness
Names showing class position within historical context
Names indicating relationship to historical events/movements
Names revealing cultural identity/heritage significance

4. Practical Implementation Process

First identify core setting parameters from your chosen setting module
Cross-reference with character function in story (their societal role)
Apply appropriate naming strategy from the relevant matrix
Generate a name pool using the selected strategy
Select distinctive names from beyond the peak of the bell curve
Apply consistent modifications for related character groups

5. Beyond-the-Bell-Curve Name Generation
To move beyond standard naming patterns:

Research actual name distribution statistics for your setting analog
Deliberately select from 50th-95th percentile range (distinctive but believable)
Apply unexpected combinations of common naming elements
Introduce logical linguistic drift based on setting history
Reverse-engineer naming evolution from future/past conditions
Create name families with consistent internal logic

This approach ensures names that:

Feel authentic to the setting
Convey character information without exposition
Avoid both clich√©s and completely unpronounceable options
Provide cultural touchstones for readers
Create cohesive naming systems rather than random collections
